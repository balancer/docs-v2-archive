# Risks

* Investment risk
* Impermanent loss
* Pools are only as strong as their weakest token
* Emergency stop
  * Here we could mention the emergency stop mechanism - Balancer governance \*temporarily\* has the ability to halt swaps on the entire Vault, or disable individual pools. After the emergency period expires, the Vault becomes trustless, and the only things governance controls are 
    * protocol-level fees, 
    * whitelisting relayers, 
    * Oracle pool assignments/overrides; 
    * setting the dynamic swap fee provider \(e.g., Gauntlet\) on pools where that is enabled - which is all our standard Weighted/Stable pools
* Smart contract risk
  * Pool
  * Vault
  * Asset Manager
* Personal Security
  * Make sure you're using official balancer websites
  * general self-custody security
    * hardware wallet
    * shill Gnosis?
  * There is no Tron token, it's a scam
