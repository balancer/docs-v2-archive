# Emergency subDAO

The [Emergency DAO](https://dao.curve.fi/emergencymembers) is an idea pioneered by Curve that empowers a small group to “kill” pools and gauges **in the** **event of malicious activity and/or potential loss of funds.** The Balancer emergency subDAO was established after the [following vote](https://vote.balancer.fi/#/proposal/0x63fab7ab9ef5b9579dabb82058b8ea309e39c766d435438b55fff8db7c1f69fd).&#x20;

The Emergency subDAO is a 4-of-7 multisig with the following members:

* Solarcurve (0x512fce9B07Ce64590849115EE6B32fd40eC0f5F3)
* Mike B (0xF01Cc7154e255D20489E091a5aEA10Bc136696a8)
* Zekraken (0xafFC70b81D54F229A5F50ec07e2c76D2AAAD07Ae)
* Zen Dragon (0x7c2eA10D3e5922ba3bBBafa39Dc0677353D2AF17)
* Markus (0x6bB4720473d4D7133f944785e5EE1A650C07f34e)

Gnosis safe address: `0xA29F61256e948F3FB707b4b3B138C5cCb9EF9888`

An additional power of the Emergency subDAO will be to add a token to the deny list on the newly created “[ProtocolFeesWithdrawer](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/introduce-protocolfeeswithdrawer/3188)” contract. In order for a token to be added back to the allow list a veBAL governance vote would be required. A token would only be added to the deny list in the event of an issue along the lines of the recent [Synthetix bug disclosure](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/medium-severity-bug-found/3161).
