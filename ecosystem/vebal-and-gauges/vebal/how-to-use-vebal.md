# How To Use veBAL

## Acquiring veBAL

{% hint style="warning" %}
**One account cannot hold distinct chunks of locked veBAL with different expiration dates**.&#x20;

If you lock additional BPT to increase an existing veBAL balance, you must also choose a new expiration date for your total veBAL balance. The earliest option is the original expiration date.
{% endhint %}

To acquire veBAL, you'll need to do the following:

* Provide liquidity to the the 80/20 BAL/WETH pool on Ethereum

* Stake the 80/20 BAL/WETH BPT to get veBAL
  * In doing so, you'll need to choose your lock period. The longer you lock, the more veBAL voting power/weighting you get, but the longer you must wait to unlock your BPT

## Extending veBAL Lock Period

* To extend your lock time, go to the veBAL page and follow the same process as locking your 80/20 BAL/WETH BPT; this time, however, you do not need provide additional 80/20 BAL/WETH BPT; instead, enter a later date in the calendar selector to extend your lock period and acquire more veBAL.
