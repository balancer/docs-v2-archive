# Managed Pools

## Overview

Managed Pools are designed to bring extreme flexibility to Balancer, unlocking possibilities for sophisticated portfolio strategies and fine-grained control.&#x20;

Managed Pools use [Weighted Math](../../../concepts/math/weighted-math.md) and allow users to have pools of up to 50 tokens. These pools provide a framework for fund managers, can be used to track a wider crypto sector, and feature time-based weight shifting mechanisms similar to those of [Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools](../liquidity-bootstrapping-pools-lbps.md).
