# Balancer x Certora Accelerator

On the [10th of October 2022](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/balancer-and-certora-launch-security-accelerator-420d3b839a37), Balancer launched the **Balancer Certora Security Accelerator** in partnership with [Certora](https://www.certora.com/). The Security Accelerator helps **projects building on Balancer** increase their code security.

The Accelerator provides code reviews and grants access to Certora’s formal verification Prover. This alignment strengthens the soundness of the code base and streamlines the go-to-market process for projects building on Balancer.

The Balancer x Certora Security Accelerator offers the following benefits:

* Two weeks of manual code review by Certora engineers familiar with Balancer’s codebase
* Set up and introduction of Certora’s formal verification Prover
* $10.000 USD worth of credits for Certora’s formal verification Prover
* Integration assistance by Balancer on code functionality and business logic
