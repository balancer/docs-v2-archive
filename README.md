# Protocol Overview

## Introduction

Balancer is a community-driven protocol, automated portfolio manager, liquidity provider, and price sensor that empowers decentralized exchange and the automated portfolio management of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and other EVM-compatible systems.

Balancer Pools contain two or more tokens that traders can swap between. Liquidity Providers put their tokens in the pools in order to collect swap fees.&#x20;

Balancer adopts powerful features to slash gas costs, super-charge capital efficiency, unlock arbitrage with zero-token starting capital, and open the door to custom AMMs.

## Revolutionary DeFi Liquidity Pools

Pools with high token counts are conceptually similar to Index Funds in traditional finance. They allow users to have access to broad exposure to a variety of tokens. Where Balancer differs from the traditional notion of an index fund, however, is in the fees.&#x20;

**Instead of paying fees** to have a broker rebalance the pool, the **pools collect fees** as they're continuously rebalanced by traders making swaps. Furthermore, high token-count pools have the advantage of having many token pairs, creating additional opportunities to collect trading fees.

Balancer's WeightedPools are based on an [N-dimensional invariant surface](https://balancer.finance/whitepaper/), a generalization of the constant product formula described by Vitalik Buterin.

## Serving Everyone

With this mechanism, the needs of both Liquidity Providers and Traders are served:

* Liquidity Providers collect trading fees, while their portfolio is continuously rebalanced
* Traders gain access to an open, decentralized exchange that never closes, allowing them to swap what and when they like for low fees
