# Other DAO Multisigs

In addition to the Balancer Governance Multisig, the DAO itself has a number of multisigs, both on mainnet and other chains, to perform narrow duties that benefit from more agility and don't demand high levels of trust. The DAO maintains a list of these multisig addresses [here](https://www.notion.so/Multisig-List-Guidelines-402e18cff13e4f2fa571bc14ed007546).
